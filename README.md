# SECOPS Framework

Welcome to the SECOPS Framework! This repository serves as a comprehensive platform for operationalizing cybersecurity practices, combining tools, resources, and workflows to strengthen security posture.

## **Overview**
The SECOPS Framework is designed to:
- Provide a centralized collection of cybersecurity tools.
- Facilitate the integration and testing of security solutions.
- Differentiate between locally executable tools and web-based services requiring registration.
- Foster custom tool development tailored to your specific operational needs.
